# Code review documentation

For the entire project, many merge/pull requests were made. In a practical case, code review is really important. Thanks to this system, tons of bug are dodged. That's why, even if we worked alone, we need to keep some code reviews.

## Code review format

Like I said earlier, the project was made by only one person. Therefore the code review format is not really as usual. Indeed, the code isn't directly commented because, in my mind, i didn't push anything before it is perfectly functional. Because of those conditions, code reviews were in a single comment by pull/merge request and this comment tell everything what have been done on the feature branch.

As a exemple, we can take this pull/merge request : https://github.com/papaiou/SoftwareQualityAssurance-FinalAssesment/pull/11.

We can see that it's a pull/merge request for unit tests. For each method that need to be tested, we have a checklist about what is tested. It's a kind of summary of the work done.

This example was taken because we can see at the end of the comment something in red. Indeed, when something should have been done, but it's still not done, the checklist came become a to do list.
