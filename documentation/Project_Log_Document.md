# Project Log Document

Using SCRUM methodology, we are supposed to split the work in sprints. Usually, in practical cases, sprints have a duration of at least 1 week, often 2 weeks.

# Task Estimation

## Main function [1.1]

-   Install work environment (Python, pip, Github) -- 1 hour
-   First compilation (Creation of the first script, first feature branch) -- 0.5 hour

    UNDER-TOTAL : 2 hours
    TOTAL : 2 hours

-   Initialisation of the class and creation of the function array -- 2 hours

    UNDER-TOTAL : 3.5 hours
    TOTAL : 5.5 hours

    UNDER-TOTAL : 16.5 hours
    TOTAL : 22 hours

## Survey class and methods [1.3]

-   Display question statistics -- 0.5 hour

    UNDER-TOTAL : 4 hours
    TOTAL : 26 hours

## SurveyResponse class and methods [1.4]

-   Initialisation of the SurveyResponse class -- 0.5 hour
-   Creation of the new SurveyResponse method with data handling -- 0.5 hour

    UNDER-TOTAL : 1 hour
    TOTAL : 27 hours

    UNDER-TOTAL 7.5 hours
    TOTAL : 34.5 hours

## Code review of the project [2.2]

-   Make the code review of all pull/merge requests -- 2 hours

    UNDER-TOTAL : 2 hours
    TOTAL : 36.5 hours

## Unit tests [3.1]

-   First wave of unit tests : 2 hours
-   Second wave of unit tests : 1.5 hours
-   Unit tests ending rectifications : 0.5 hour

    UNDER-TOTAL : 4 hours
    TOTAL : 40.5 hours

## Coverage [3.2]

-   Installing dependencies for the coverage module -- 0.5 hour
-   Finding solution for checking code coverage of the project [here](./coverage_documentation.md) -- 1.5 hour

    UNDER-TOTAL : 2 hours
    TOTAL : 42.5 hours


Now that Task estimation is finished, we can see that 42.5 hours of work are needed for the project, but that's not sufficient to make 2 sprints. In this case we can admit that this project will be made in a single sprint.
